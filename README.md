Crazy Machine

The machine I would choose to build, if given the chance, would be a refrigerator that has a touch screen built onto it. The built in screen would include all the groceries that your fridge has inside of it. From there, the consumer would tell the refrigerator what they are in the mood to eat. The fridge would be linked up to the Internet, where it could pull up recipes from there. If the fridge does not have a particular food item, it would let the user know via an error message on the touch screen. For example, a consumer has fruits, milk, juice, and peanut butter. That particular consumer wanted a smoothie, so the fridge would look up a recipe online and the user would confirm that was the recipe they wanted. After that, the fridge would make the smoothie and then an alert would appear to have a cup ready so you could serve the smoothie. The consumer would have to from the beginning confirm how much they want, serving size wise. Certain labels would have to be on each food item to have a sensor so the fridge could recognize the item.
